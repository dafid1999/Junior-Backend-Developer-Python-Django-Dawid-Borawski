Hello world! This is a test file for the text processing functionality.
The application should scramble the letters in the middle of each word while keeping the first and last letters in their original positions.

For example:
- "programming" might become "pgrammorng" or "prgramomng"
- "django" might become "djgano" or "djanog"
- "python" might become "ptyhon" or "pthyon"

Punctuation marks, spaces, and special characters should remain unchanged.
Numbers like 123 and short words like "is", "a", "an" should stay the same.

This is quite an interesting algorithm that demonstrates how our brains can still read scrambled text as long as the first and last letters are in the right place!
